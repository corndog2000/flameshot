void CaptureWidget::updateButtons() seems to create all the buttons for the capture window qt gui thingie

capturewidget.h seems to have methods to resize and move the capture area

QVector<CaptureToolButton::ButtonType> ConfigHandler::getButtons() appears to setup the list of buttons and create each instance of each tool class

Each class has their own pressed method that gets called when pressed from this method: void CaptureWidget::processTool(CaptureTool* t)
